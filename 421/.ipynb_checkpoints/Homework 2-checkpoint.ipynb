    "#### A) Depth-first search always expands at least as many nodes as A∗ search with an admissi- ble heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**False**: Since the heurisitic is admissable, A* search will choose nodes to expand based off of f(x) = g(x) + h(x). This allows A* search to expand more nodes based of it's f(x) value. Depth-First Search can arrive at a solution quicker and expand less nodes (though it might not be the most optimal) than A*.  "

If there is an obstacle in the rook's way, then the actual shortest path will be greater than the manahattan distance.\n"
