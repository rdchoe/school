    "Problem 1: Consider a genetic algorithm problem having the following properties. Each state is a string of 6 digits, so a state can be any string from \"000000\" to \"999999\". The initial population is a set of states {s1,...,sn}, where n is a constant. Reproduction is done by selecting two states s and t from the population, and creating a new state that contains the first i digits of s followed by the last 6 – i digits of t, where i is a random number in {0,1,...,6}. Mutation is not allowed.\n",

    "5.9 This problem exercises the basic concepts of game playing, using tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) as an example. We define Xn as the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with exactly n X’s and no O’s. Similarly, On is the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with just n O’s. The utility function assigns +1 to any position with X3 = 1 and −1 to any position with O3 = 1. All other terminal positions have utility 0. For nonterminal positions, we use a linear evaluation function defined as Eval(s) = 3X2(s)+X1(s)−(3O2(s)+O1(s)).  \n",

    "5.10 Consider the family of generalized tic-tac-toe games, defined as follows. Each partic- ular game is specified by a set S of squares and a collection W of winning positions. Each winning position is a subset of S. For example, in standard tic-tac-toe, S is a set of 9 squares and W is a collection of 8 subsets of W: the three rows, the three columns, and the two diag- onals. In other respects, the game is identical to standard tic-tac-toe. Starting from an empty board, players alternate placing their marks on an empty square. A player who marks every square in a winning position wins the game. It is a tie if all squares are marked and neither player has won.  \n",

    "a. Let N = |S|, the number of squares. Give an upper bound on the number of nodes in the complete game tree for generalized tic-tac-toe as a function of N.    \n",

    "d. Assume that it is possible to generate a new board and check whether it is a winning position in 100N machine instructions and assume a 2 gigahertz processor. Ignore memory limitations. Using your estimate in (a), roughly how large a game tree can be completely solved by alpha–beta in a second of CPU time? a minute? an hour?"

    "5.16 This question considers pruning in games with chance nodes. Figure 5.19 shows the complete game tree for a trivial game.
